\title{Create a list object of class peak}
\description{
  This is just a simple convenience function to create a \code{list}
  of class \code{peak}.
}
\usage{
newPeak(name, chr, start, end, cellType = NULL, modification, maxPeak, score = NULL, probes = c(), ...)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{name}{character; (if possible) unique identifier for the peak}
  \item{chr}{character; chromosome the peak is located on}
  \item{start}{integer; genomic start coordinate of the peak}
  \item{end}{integer; genomic end coordinate of the peak}
  \item{cellType}{optional character describing the cell type in which
    the peak was identified.}
  \item{modification}{required character vector describing the
    modification or characteristic for which fragments were supposedly
    enriched in immuno-precipitation step}
  \item{maxPeak}{numeric; maximal probe level in teh peak}
  \item{score}{optional numeric score of the peak}
  \item{probes}{optional character vector of probe identifiers of probes
  that make up the peak}
  \item{\dots}{further arguments that will be additional elements of the
  \code{peak} list object}
}
\value{
  a list object of class \code{peak}, see \code{\link{peak-class}}
}

\note{
  this function is called by other Ringo functions, such as
  \code{\link{findPeaksOnSmoothed}} and normally need not be called by
  the user.
