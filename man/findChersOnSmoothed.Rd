\title{Find Chers on smoothed ExpressionSet}
\description{
  Given an ExpressionSet of smoothed probe intensities, an environment
  with the mapping of probes to chromosomes, and a vector of thresholds
  for calling genomic sites enriched, this function finds the
  'chers' (ChIP-enriched regions)
  consisting of enriched genomic positions, with probes mapped to them.
  'Adjacent' enriched positions are condensed into a single Cher.
}
\usage{
findChersOnSmoothed(smoothedX, probeAnno, thresholds, allChr = c(1:19,
 "X", "Y"), distCutOff = 600, minProbesInRow = 3, cellType = NULL,
 checkUnique = TRUE, uniqueCodes = c(0), verbose = TRUE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{smoothedX}{Object of class \code{ExpressionSet} holding the
    smoothed probe intensities, e.g. the result of function
    \code{computeRunningMedians}.}
  \item{probeAnno}{environment containing the probe to genome mapping}
  \item{thresholds}{numeric vector of threshold above which smoothed
    probe intensities are considered to correspond to enriched
    probes. The vector has to be of length equal the number of samples
    in \code{smoothedX}, with a single threshold for each sample.}
  \item{allChr}{character vector of all chromosomes, on which Chers are
    to be found. Every chromosome here has to have probes mapped to it
    in the \code{probeAnno} environment.}
  \item{distCutOff}{integer; maximum amount of base pairs at which
    enriched probes are condensed into one Cher.}
  \item{minProbesInRow}{integer; minimum number of enriched
    probes required for a Cher; see \code{details} for further
    explanation.}
  \item{cellType}{character; name of cell type the data comes from, is
    either a. of length one indicating the column of
    \code{pData(smoothedX)} that holds the cell type OR b. of length one
    indicating the common cell type for all samples in the
    \code{ExpressionSet} OR c. of length equal to \code{ncol(smoothedX)}
    specifying the cell type of each sample individually.}
  \item{checkUnique}{logical; indicates whether the uniqueness
    indicator of probe matches from the probeAnno environment should be
    used.}
  \item{uniqueCodes}{numeric; which numeric codes in the chromosome-wise
    match-uniqueness elements of the probeAnno environment indicate
    uniqueness?}
  \item{verbose}{logical; extended output to STDOUT?}
}
\value{
  A list of class \code{cherList}, holding objects of class \code{cher}
  that were found on the supplied data.
}
\details{
   Specifying a minimum number of probes for a Cher (argument
   \code{minProbesInRow})  guarantees that a Cher is supported by a
   reasonable number of measurements in probe-sparse regions.
   For example, if there's only one enriched probe within a certain
   genomic 1kb region and no other probes can been mapped to that
   region, this single probe does arguably not provide enough evidence
   for calling this genomic region enriched.
