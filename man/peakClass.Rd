\title{Class peak - A list holding ChIP-chip peak characteristics}
\description{
  An object of class \code{peak} is a list holding characteristics of an
  enrichment peak from ChIP chip data. While this is only a S3 rather
  than a formal \code{S4} class (yet), the presence of certain list
  elements enables a standardized approach to working with enriched
  regions identified from ChIP-chip data.
}
\section{Slots/List Components}{
  \describe{
    \item{name}{required character vector of length 1
    unequivocally describing the peak, e.g. "Suz12.Nudt2.upstream.peak"}
    \item{chr}{required character vector of length one, naming the
    chromosome of the peak, e.g. "9" }
    \item{start}{required integer of peak start position on the
    chromosome, e.g. 34318900 }
    \item{end}{required integer of peak start position on the
    chromosome, e.g. 34320100 }
    \item{cellType}{optional character vector describing the cell
    type the ChIP chip experiment has been done on, e.g. "human"}
    \item{antibody}{required character vector describing the
    antibody or characteristic for which fragments were supposedly
    enriched in immuno-precipitation step,
    e.g. "Suz12" for the protein Suz12}
    \item{typeUpstream}{optional character vector of features that this
    peak is located upstream of,
    e.g. the transcriptional start site of "ENST00000379158".
    See \code{\link{relatePeaks}} for details.}
    \item{typeDownstream}{ optional character vector of features
    that this peak is located downstream of }
    \item{maxPeak}{optional numeric of maximal (smoothed) probe level
    in the peak, e.g. 2.00}
    \item{score}{optional numeric of a peak score, currently we use the
    sum of smoothed probe levels (log fold changes), e.g. 69.16}
    \item{probes}{optional character vector of probe identifiers of
    all probes with match positions in the peak }
    \item{distMid2TSS}{optional named numeric vector of distances of
    the peak middle position to features,
    e.g. TSSs of transcripts up- and downstream; names are
    the features to which the distances are given; only
    meaningful in combination with \code{typeUpstream} and
    \code{typeDownstram}; e.g. 55 with name "ENST00000379158"}
    \item{upSymbol}{optional character vector of gene symbols of
    features the peak is located upstream of; supplements
    \code{typeUpstream}; e.g. "Nudt2" }
    \item{downSymbol}{optional character vector of gene symbols of
    features the peak is located upstream of; supplements
    \code{typeDownstream}.}
    \item{\ldots}{further list elements can be added like normal list
    elements.}
 }
}
\section{Creation}{
  Objects of class \code{peak} are created by other functions,
  such as \code{\link{findPeaksOnSmoothed}}; or by creating a list with
  the respective components and assigning it the class \code{peak},
  which is essentially, what the function \code{\link{newPeak}} does.
}
\section{Methods}{
  Methods defined for lists of class \code{peak} are
  \code{print.peak} and \code{\link{plot.peak}}.
}
\section{peakList}{
  A list in which each element is of class \code{peak}, is called
  a \code{peakList}. This class, however, is not much in use yet.
