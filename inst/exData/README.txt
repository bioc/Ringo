The example data in this directory are some snippets of the demo ChIP-chip
data that NimbleGen provide on their FTP server for free download. 
ftp://ftp.nimblegen.com/pub/demo_data/

Of the original files, only those parts concerning reporters/probes
matching the forward strand (Container: FORWARD1) of chromosome 9 
are provided here to keep these example files reasonably small.

These snippets are used as an example data within Ringo with permission
of NimbleGen Systems, Inc.
